[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) provides some very good refactorings. Some codebases that [we](http://www.stateofflow.com) have 'inherited' have needed more than the set of refactorings provided by Eclipse, so we decided to write those that we thought would be most beneficial.

Tane is at an early stage of development. We have only implemented three refactorings ([Hide Delegate](http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/hideDelegate.html), [Reduce Scope](http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/reduceScopeOfVariable.html) and Unify Declarations). If you are interested in contributing, either with more refactorings or by improving the work we've started, please [get in touch](http://groups.google.com/group/tane-eclipse-refactorings).

To install Tane, please use the update site - http://www.stateofflow.com/UpdateSite - or download the plugin from [here](http://code.google.com/p/tane/downloads/list).

Tane (pronounced '**Tah**-ney') is a Polynesian god who lets light into the world every morning by lifting up a corner of the dark sky.
